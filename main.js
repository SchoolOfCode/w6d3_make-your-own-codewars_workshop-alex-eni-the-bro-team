// EEExcEEEllEEEnt strings
// You've been looking at some memes and you came across the famous E meme. You want to post some epic E related comments, but your mechanical keyboard can't handle that many E presses! As a result, you would like to increase your E count without it wearing down your keyboard. Your function should replace every e/E with 3 capital E's.
// You will always be given a string which contains only the English alphabet, with both upper case and lower case characters. 
// Example: "Jasien's lesson was interesting"
// Should return: "JasiEEEn's lEEEsson was intEEErEEEsting"


module.exports = function eeeNator(string) {
// your function goes here!
}
